# Hacker's Linktree - sudo-hope0529

**Welcome to Krishna's personal Linktree page**, a centralized hub for all my online presence, projects, and hacker-related content. Hosted on GitHub Pages at [sudo-hope0529.github.io/Link-tree/](https://sudo-hope0529.github.io/Link-tree/), this custom Linktree clone is tailored to showcase my digital footprint with a tech-savvy, hacker aesthetic. Whether you're here to explore my cybersecurity projects, connect on social media, or check out my latest hacks, this page has it all in one place.

## About This Project

This repository hosts a simple, customizable Linktree alternative built for personal branding with a *hacker twist*. Unlike the standard Linktree, this page is fully self-hosted on GitHub Pages, giving me complete control over design and functionality. It's lightweight, easy to modify, and perfect for anyone looking to create a central hub for their online links with a unique style.

## Features

- **Hacker Aesthetic**: Dark mode design with a terminal-like interface to reflect my cybersecurity and hacking background.
- **Custom Links**: Direct access to my GitHub, social media, personal blog, and hacker-related projects.
- **Self-Hosted**: Hosted on GitHub Pages for free, ensuring full ownership and customization.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices for easy access anywhere.
- **Open Source**: Feel free to fork this repository and adapt it for your own use.

## How It Works

This Linktree clone is a static webpage built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, deployed via GitHub Pages. The setup leverages GitHub's free hosting to serve the page directly from this repository. The design is minimalistic yet functional, focusing on quick navigation to my various online platforms and projects.

## Setup Instructions (For Customization)

If you want to create your own Linktree page using this repository as a base, follow these steps:

1. **Fork or Clone the Repository**: Start by forking this repository or cloning it to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/sudo-hope0529/Link-tree.git`.
2. **Customize the Links**: Open the `index.html` file and replace my links with your own. Update the profile information, social media handles, and any other relevant URLs.
3. **Modify the Design**: Edit the CSS in the `styles.css` file to match your personal style or branding. You can change colors, fonts, or add animations to suit your theme.
4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub named `username.github.io` (replace `username` with your GitHub username).
   - Push your modified files to this repository.
   - Go to the repository settings, navigate to the "Pages" section, and set the source to the `main` branch (or wherever your `index.html` resides).
   - Your custom Linktree will be live at `username.github.io`.
5. **Optional - Custom Domain**: If you have a custom domain, you can link it to your GitHub Pages site by updating the DNS settings and adding a `CNAME` file to your repository.
